	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Supernova explosions of massive stars are one of the primary sites for the production of the elements in the universe. Up to now, stars with zero-age main-sequence masses in the range of 35–50 M⊙ had mostly represented the failed supernova explosion branch. In contrast, it has been demonstrated recently that the appearance of exotic phases of hot and dense matter, associated with a sufficiently strong phase transition from nuclear matter to the quark-gluon plasma at high baryon density, can trigger supernova explosions of such massive supergiant stars. Here, we present the first results obtained from an extensive nucleosynthesis analysis for material being ejected from the surface of the newly born proto-neutron stars of such supernova explosions. These ejecta contain an early neutron-rich component and a late-time high-entropy neutrino-driven wind. The nucleosynthesis robustly overcomes the production of nuclei associated with the second r-process peak, at nuclear mass number A ≃ 130, and proceeds beyond the formation of the third peak (A ≃ 195) to the actinides. These yields may account for metal-poor star observations concerning r-process elements such as strontium and europium in the Galaxy at low metallicity, while the actinide yields suggests that this source may be a candidate contributing to the abundances of radioactive 244Pu measured in deep-sea sediments on Earth.}

abstract = {By comparing results from r-process parameter studies within the classical waiting-point approximation with the observed solar-system r-abundance distribution Nr,⊙, in-formation on nuclear-structure phenomena on neutron-rich isotopes far off the stability line can be obtained. Such information is — to a large extent — experimentally not accessible. Investigations in the early 1990's, making use of QRPA β-decay properties and nuclear masses from the macroscopic-microscopic FRDM and ETFSI-1 models, showed r-abundance deficiencies around A⋍115 and 180, indicating overly strong N=82 and 126 shell strengths far from stability. Recent experiments in the A⋍110–130 region as well as more microscopic mass models, such as the spherical HFB/SkP ansatz and the deformed ETFSI-Q formalism, seem to confirm our earlier predictions, in particular shell-quenching and neutron-skin effects. These new nuclear-structure phenomena have important astrophysical implications for r-process calculations. Not only do they result in a considerable improvement of the global Nr,⊙ fits, but also they put tighter constraints on the neutron densities required and on the duration of the r-process. Moreover, abundance calculations of the classical r-process cosmochronometers are now based on an internally consistent nuclear-physics input, which allows meaningful comparisons with the latest astronomical observations of ultra-metal-poor halo stars.}

The dynamical r-process calculations are performed under the neutrino-driven wind scenario. In comparison with the finite-range droplet model (FRDM) often used in r-process calculations, better agreement between the calculated abundance and the observed solar r-process abundance is found in both the classical and dynamical calculations by using the mass model WS4. The abundance underestimations at the A ∼ 115, 140, and 200 mass regions encountered with the calculations using the FRDM is overcome to a large extent by using WS4.}

abstract = {The astrophysical rapid neutron capture process or ‘r process’ of nucleosynthesis is believed to be responsible for the production of approximately half the heavy element abundances found in nature. This multifaceted problem remains one of the greatest open challenges in all of physics. Knowledge of nuclear physics properties such as masses, β-decay and neutron capture rates, as well as β-delayed neutron emission probabilities are critical inputs that go into calculations of r-process nucleosynthesis. While properties of nuclei near stability have been established, much still remains unknown regarding neutron-rich nuclei far from stability that may participate in the r process. Sensitivity studies gauge the astrophysical response of a change in nuclear physics input(s) which allows for the isolation of the most important nuclear properties that shape the final abundances observed in nature. This review summarizes the extent of recent sensitivity studies and highlights how these studies play a key role in facilitating new insight into the r process. The development of these tools promotes a focused effort for state-of-the-art measurements, motivates construction of new facilities and will ultimately move the community toward addressing the grand challenge of ‘How were the elements from iron to uranium made?’.}

Tellurium (Te, Z = 52) is found at the second r -process peak ( A ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 130) associated with the N = 82 neutron shell closure, and it has not been detected previously in Galactic halo stars.

We derive abundances of Cu II , Zn II , As I , Se I , Mo II , and Cd II , which have not been detected previously in either star. Abundances derived for Ge I , Te I , Os II , and Pt I confirm those derived from lines at longer wavelengths. We also derive upper limits from the non-detection of W II , Hg II , Pb II , and Bi I . The mean [As/Fe] ratio derived from these two stars and five others in the literature is unchanged over the metallicity range –2.8 < [Fe/H] <–0.6, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} [As/Fe] ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = +0.28 ± 0.14 (σ = 0.36 dex).

The As and Se abundances are enhanced relative to a simple extrapolation of the iron-peak abundances to higher masses, suggesting that this mass region (75 ≤ A ≤ 82) may be the point at which a different nucleosynthetic mechanism begins to dominate the quasi-equilibrium α-rich freezeout of the iron peak. ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} [Cu II /Cu I ] ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = +0.56 ± 0.23 in HD 108317 and HD 128279, and we infer that lines of Cu I may not be formed in local thermodynamic equilibrium in these stars. The [Zn/Fe], [Mo/Fe], [Cd/Fe], and [Os/Fe] ratios are also derived from neutral and ionized species, and each ratio pair agrees within the mutual uncertainties, which range from 0.15 to 0.52 dex.}

  abstract={New abundances for neutron-capture ( n -capture) elements in a large sample of metal-poor giants from the Bond survey are presented. The spectra were acquired with the KPNO 4 m echelle and coudé feed spectrographs, and have been analyzed using LTE fine-analysis techniques with both line analysis and spectral synthesis. Abundances of eight n -capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu, and Dy) in 43 stars have been derived from blue (λλ4070-4710, R ~ 20,000, S/N ratio ~ 100-200) echelle spectra and red (λλ6100-6180, R ~ 22,000, S/N ratio ~ 100-200) coudé spectra, and the abundance of Ba only has been derived from the red spectra for an additional 27 stars. Overall, the abundances show clear evidence for a large star-to-star dispersion in the heavy element-to-iron ratios. This condition must have arisen from individual nucleosynthetic events in rapidly evolving halo progenitors that injected newly manufactured n -capture elements into an inhomogeneous early Galactic halo interstellar medium. The new data also confirm that at metallicities [Fe/H] ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} -2.4, the abundance pattern of the heavy ( Z ≥ 56) n -capture elements in most giants is well-matched to a scaled solar system r -process nucleosynthesis pattern. The onset of the main r -process can be seen at [Fe/H] ≈ -2.9; this onset is consistent with the suggestion that low mass Type II supernovae are responsible for the r -process. Contributions from the s -process can first be seen in some stars with metallicities as low as [Fe/H] ~ -2.75 and are present in most stars with metallicities [Fe/H] > -2.3. The appearance of s -process contributions as metallicity increases presumably reflects the longer stellar evolutionary timescale of the (low-mass) s -process nucleosynthesis sites. The lighter n -capture elements (Sr-Y-Zr) are enhanced relative to the heavier r -process element abundances. Their production cannot be attributed solely to any combination of the solar system r- and main s- processes, but requires a mixture of material from the r -process and from an additional n -capture process that can operate at early Galactic time. This additional process could be the weak s -process in massive (~25 M ☉ ) stars, or perhaps a second r -process site, i.e., different from the site that produces the heavier ( Z ≥ 56) n -capture elements.}

  abstract={We investigate systematically the dynamical mass ejection, r -process nucleosynthesis, and properties of electromagnetic counterparts of neutron-star (NS) mergers in dependence on the uncertain properties of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) by employing 40 representative, microphysical high-density EOSs in relativistic, hydrodynamical simulations. The crucial parameter determining the ejecta mass is the radius R 1.35 of a 1.35 M ☉ NS. NSs with smaller R 1.35 ("soft" EOS) eject systematically higher masses. These range from ~10 –3 M ☉ to ~10 –2 M ☉ for 1.35-1.35 M ☉ binaries and from ~5 × 10 –3 M ☉ to ~2 × 10 –2 M ☉ for 1.2-1.5 M ☉ systems (with kinetic energies between ~5 × 10 49 erg and 10 51 erg). Correspondingly, the bolometric peak luminosities of the optical transients of symmetric (asymmetric) mergers vary between 3 × 10 41 erg s –1 and 14 × 10 41  erg s –1 (9 × 10 41 erg s –1 and 14.5 × 10 41 erg s –1 ) on timescales between ~2 hr and ~12 hr. If these signals with absolute bolometric magnitudes from –15.0 to –16.7 are measured, the tight correlation of their properties with those of the merging NSs might provide valuable constraints on the high-density EOS. The r -process nucleosynthesis exhibits a remarkable robustness independent of the EOS, producing a nearly solar abundance pattern above mass number 130. By the r -process content of the Galaxy and the average production per event the Galactic merger rate is limited to 4 × 10 –5 yr –1 (4 × 10 –4 yr –1 ) for a soft (stiff) NS EOS, if NS mergers are the main source of heavy r -nuclei. The production ratio of radioactive 232 Th to 238 U attains a stable value of 1.64-1.67, which does not exclude NS mergers as potential sources of heavy r -material in the most metal-poor stars.}

  abstract={Recent studies suggest that binary neutron star (NS-NS) mergers robustly produce heavy r -process nuclei above the atomic mass number A ~ 130 because their ejecta consist of almost pure neutrons (electron fraction of Y e < 0.1). However, the production of a small amount of the lighter r -process nuclei ( A ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 90-120) conflicts with the spectroscopic results of r -process-enhanced Galactic halo stars. We present, for the first time, the result of nucleosynthesis calculations based on the fully general relativistic simulation of a NS-NS merger with approximate neutrino transport. It is found that the bulk of the dynamical ejecta are appreciably shock-heated and neutrino processed, resulting in a wide range of Y e ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 0.09-0.45). The mass-averaged abundance distribution of calculated nucleosynthesis yields is in reasonable agreement with the full-mass range ( A ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 90-240) of the solar r -process curve. This implies, if our model is representative of such events, that the dynamical ejecta of NS-NS mergers could be the origin of the Galactic r -process nuclei. Our result also shows that radioactive heating after ~1 day from the merging, which gives rise to r -process-powered transient emission, is dominated by the β-decays of several species close to stability with precisely measured half-lives. This implies that the total radioactive heating rate for such an event can be well constrained within about a factor of two if the ejected material has a solar-like r -process pattern.}

  abstract={The high-entropy, evacuated region forming just outside the proto-neutron star during a core-collapse supernova makes an excellent site for the r-process. The high entropy per baryon allows this region to have a high free neutron/seed nucleus ratio, a necessary requirement for the r-process, even though the material is not particularly neutron rich. The neutrino-driven wind blowing from the hot bubble lasts several seconds and has a mass loss rate of roughly 10 -5 M (.) s -1 . The total mass of r-process matter produced during the supernova is thus approximately 10 -4 M (.) , in good agreement with arguments from galactic chemical evolution. The hot-bubble r-process achieves local steady beta flow, in agreement with results from experimental nuclear physics. Deficiencies in the present model may reflect in part failings of the nuclear mass extrapolation used. It may be possible to constrain nuclear and neutrino physics through the r-process.}

    abstract = { Let \$( A\_{ij} )\$, i, \$j \in V\$ be the matrix with entries \$ - a\_{ij} \$ if \$i \ne j\$ and diagonal entries such that all the column sums are zero. Let \$ a\_{ij} \$ be a variable associated with arc \$ij\$ in the complete digraph G on vertices V. Let \$| A ( \bar{W}|\bar{U} ) |\$ be the matrix that results from deleting sets of k rows W and columns U from A. The all minors matrix tree theorem states that \$ | A ( \bar{W}|\bar{U} ) |\$ enumerates the forests in G that have (a) k trees, (b) each tree contains exactly one vertex in U and exactly one vertex in W, and (c) each arc is directed away from the vertex in U of the tree containing the arc. We give an elementary combinatorial proof in which we show that each of the terms in \$| A ( \bar{W}|\bar{U} ) |\$ that corresponds to an enumerated forest occurs just once and the other terms cancel. The sign of each term is determined by the parity of the linking from U to W contained in the forest, and is easy to calculate explicitly in the proof.The results are extended to signed graphs. The theorem provides a coordinatization (linear representation) of gammoids that is in a certain sense natural. }

The proof is based on a specific factorization of the Laplacian matrices associated to the graphs, which involves only the two incidence matrices that capture the graph's topology. We also point out how this result can be used to calculate principal eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrices. }
